# The common external-executor contract

The six historical native/provider executor declarations are retained by this kit — GLM, Kimi, Grok,
Qwen, DeepSeek, and Gemini. Each has its own runner, its own transport, its own
sandbox, and its own reasons for refusing. That is deliberate, and this page does
not change it.

What was missing was a **shared vocabulary**: the same words for the same things
across six runners, so drift is detectable instead of invisible.
[`config/external-executor-contract.json`](https://github.com/matteoscurati/delegation-kit/blob/main/config/external-executor-contract.json)
is that historical vocabulary, and `delegation-executor-contract` validates it.
For current configuration, the new custom adapter and review policy, see
[user configuration](/docs/configuration). The historical contract describes
its pinned evaluation variants; custom profiles use the versioned routing and
run receipts. Permission and patch verification requirements below still apply.

## The boundary, stated once

- **The common contract describes and validates.** It is a declaration of what
  each runner already does, checked against
  [`config/routing-gates.json`](https://github.com/matteoscurati/delegation-kit/blob/main/config/routing-gates.json) and each
  executable `config/*-routing.json` gate.
- **Each provider runner remains the sole enforcement authority.** Permission
  enforcement stays runner-specific and explicit: `delegation-kimi` builds its
  own sandbox profile and tool allowlist, `delegation-grok` attests its own
  sandbox, `delegation-glm` chooses its own Claude Code permission mode, and the
  text-only bridges have no filesystem at all.
- **Declaring a lane grants it nothing.** No permission, no route, no capability
  is created by an entry in this file. If the contract and a runner disagree,
  the runner wins at runtime and the disagreement is a validation failure to be
  fixed in the contract — never a reason to widen a runner.
- **`delegation-run` forwards a selected user profile to its adapter.** No runner
  reads the contract; the regression suite asserts that. The contract is
  inspected by people and by CI, not by dispatch code.

## Permission classes

Exactly three, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive over every declared lane:

| class | worktree writes | returns a patch | what it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | no | no | The runner grants no write capability and the lane's product is analysis text. |
| `text-patch` | no | yes | The runner has no filesystem write capability; the lane returns patch text the lead applies and verifies. |
| `worktree-edit` | yes | no | The runner grants scoped write access to the delegated worktree and the executor edits in place. |

`text-patch` is separated from `read-only` because the two impose different work
on the lead: a diff still has to be applied and checked. Mutual exclusivity is
mechanical — each class carries a distinct `(worktree_writes, returns_patch)`
pair, and the validator rejects a contract in which two classes collide, a fourth
class appears, or one of the three is removed.

Two descriptive fields sit alongside the class and are checked against it:

- `worktree_access` — `none` (prompt-only transports), `read`, or `read-write`.
- `tool_policy.write_scope` — `none` or `workdir`. Runner-private scratch space
  is not a worktree write and is deliberately out of scope.

`worktree-edit` requires `read-write` + `workdir`; every other class requires
`write_scope: none` and forbids `read-write`.

Every `text-patch` lane additionally carries a `patch_policy` block — see
[the patch verifier](#the-patch-verifier-for-text-patch-lanes) below — and no
lane of any other class may carry one.

## Runtime controls, and how drift is caught

Every lane declares a complete `tool_policy`. There is no optional field and no
`null`: `permission_mode`, `allowed_tools`, `write_scope`, `terminal`,
`network`, `mcp`, `plugins`, and `subagents` are all mandatory, and a missing,
null, or unrecognised value fails `check`.

The five capability fields use a closed two-value vocabulary, because there are
exactly two honest things to say about them:

| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| `denied` | The runner removes the capability — an explicit deny, an omission from a runner-passed tool allowlist, or a transport with no such tool at all. |
| `permission-mode-gated` | The runner does **not** remove it. Whether a call succeeds follows from the permission mode the runner pins. |

`permission-mode-gated` is a deliberately narrowed claim. `delegation-glm`
launches Claude Code with `--permission-mode plan` (or `acceptEdits` for
builder), `--setting-sources ''`, and `--strict-mcp-config`. That authoritatively
denies MCP and plugins, but it passes no tool allowlist — so terminal, network,
and subagent availability follow from the pinned mode, and the contract says
exactly that instead of claiming a denial it cannot substantiate. `allowed_tools`
is `null` for the same reason, and only a permission-mode lane is allowed to
leave it null.

Each lane's controls are mirrored in that family's executable
`config/*-routing.json` gate under
`lanes.<lane>.backends.<backend>.runtime_controls`, and `check` compares all ten
security-relevant fields **exactly**:

`permission_mode`, `worktree_edits`, `worktree_access`, `write_scope`,
`terminal`, `network`, `mcp`, `plugins`, `subagents`, `tools`.

A gate row without a `runtime_controls` object, missing one of the ten, or
carrying a field the contract does not declare, fails. This is the fail-closed
part: a check is never skipped because a field happens to be absent. Gates may
carry additional descriptive keys — `sandbox`, `oauth_modes`, `max_turns`,
`timeout_seconds`, and the rest listed in
`executable_gate_controls.descriptive_fields` — and the contract makes no claim
about those.

### Isolation metadata is a claim, so it is checked

The two isolation keys are the exception, because an overstated isolation claim
reads as a security property. `isolated_home` and `isolated_config_dir` are
listed in `executable_gate_controls.isolation_cross_checked_against` and compared
against the family's `runtime_isolation`: a gate row that states one must state
exactly the declared value, and a family that declares one must have it stated by
at least one row of its own gate. A row may omit an isolation key — it then
claims nothing — but it may never claim an isolation the family does not declare.

The distinction the two keys draw is deliberate:

| key | claim |
|---|---|
| `isolated_home` | the runner pins a private `HOME` for an **ordinary** dispatch, not merely inside an evaluation harness |
| `isolated_config_dir` | only the harness's own configuration directory is redirected per run |

`delegation-glm` is the case that forced the distinction. An ordinary GLM
dispatch sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to a per-run temporary directory and leaves
`HOME` as the caller's; only the evaluation path runs under `env -i` with a
temporary `HOME`. So every GLM lane declares `isolated_home: false` and
`isolated_config_dir: true`, and the regression suite pins both. Kimi, Grok, and
Gemini do isolate `HOME` on an ordinary run and declare `isolated_home: true`;
the two chat-completions bridges have no home to isolate and declare neither.

`runtime_controls` is metadata. No runner and no router reads it; `tests/routing-gates.sh`
asserts that stripping it from every external gate changes no route decision.

## Current declarations

| family | runner | transport | lanes with a class other than read-only |
|---|---|---|---|
| `glm-5.3-flash` | `delegation-glm` | Claude Code against Z.AI | `builder` → `worktree-edit` (`acceptEdits`) |
| `kimi-k3` | `delegation-kimi` | native Kimi Code CLI | `builder`, `frontend-builder` → `worktree-edit` |
| `grok-4.6` | `delegation-grok` | Grok Build CLI | `builder`, `frontend-builder` → `worktree-edit` |
| `qwen3.8-max` | `delegation-qwen` | chat-completions | `builder` → `text-patch` |
| `deepseek-flash` | `delegation-deepseek` | chat-completions | `builder` → `text-patch` |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | `delegation-gemini` | Antigravity, prompt-only | `builder`, `frontend-builder` → `text-patch` |

Every other declared lane is `read-only`, and every judgement, reviewer, and
policy-annotation lane is non-dispatchable. Blocked and candidate lanes are
declared so the contract stays complete, and the validator refuses a contract in
which any of them becomes dispatchable.

Selection is user-directed: the shared vocabulary holds only `explicit-only`
(user-selectable) and `blocked`, every dispatchable lane carries
`requires_explicit_decision: true`, and the contract records that fact without
being able to prove user intent or grant permission — the native host policy and
each runner remain responsible for their own enforcement.

The lead's discovery flow never dispatches:

```sh
delegation-route lane builder --json
delegation-route resolve --lane builder --json
delegation-route resolve --lane builder --selected-profile grok-build --json
```

The four `text-patch` lanes — Qwen and DeepSeek `builder`, plus the two blocked
Gemini lanes — each declare the versioned patch policy that
[`delegation-patch-verify`](#the-patch-verifier-for-text-patch-lanes) enforces.

Run `delegation-executor-contract table` for the full 35-row picture.

## The patch verifier, for `text-patch` lanes

A `text-patch` lane has no filesystem, no tools, and no terminal. Its product is
diff text, and somebody has to apply it. That somebody is the lead — which means
the trust boundary is not at dispatch, where the runner stands, but at the point
where a human pastes a stranger's diff into their own repository.

[`config/external-patch-policy.json`](https://github.com/matteoscurati/delegation-kit/blob/main/config/external-patch-policy.json) is
the versioned policy for that moment, and `delegation-patch-verify` enforces it.

**The verifier never applies a patch.** It parses it, holds it against the
policy, fixes the strip level from the header shape, asks `git apply --check`
whether the patch applies at that one level, and prints a receipt. Applying and
testing stay with the lead.

Authority is split three ways and is never merged:

| actor | enforces |
|---|---|
| `delegation-patch-verify` | patch safety: confinement, shape, limits, applicability |
| the provider runner | transport, credentials, sandbox, tools, refusals |
| the lead | applying the patch, running the tests, deciding it is correct |

A clean receipt is a **confinement** statement. It says the diff touches only
ordinary files inside the worktree and applies cleanly at a known `-p`. It says
nothing about whether the change is right, and it promotes nothing.

### The lead's workflow, exactly

```sh
# 1. verify — read-only; nothing is applied and nothing is written
delegation-patch-verify check \
  --patch "$patch" --workdir "$repo" --json >receipt.json

# 2. inspect the receipt: verdict, paths, operations, and the strip level
jq '{verdict, file_count, operations, strip, files: [.files[].path], violations}' receipt.json

# 3. the LEAD applies it, with the strip level the receipt recorded
git -C "$repo" apply -p"$(jq -r '.strip.chosen' receipt.json)" -- "$patch"

# 4. the LEAD runs the tests — provider output is never proof that a change works
( cd "$repo" && ./run-tests.sh )

# 5. cross-family review of the result, per the routing rules
```

Step 3 is the only step that writes, and it is not the verifier's step. If the
verdict is anything but `accepted`, stop: read the diff by hand, or ask the lane
for a patch that does not need the exception.

### What the default policy refuses

Fail-closed throughout. A shape the policy does not recognise is rejected, never
skipped.

| area | rule |
|---|---|
| the patch file | regular file, not a symlink, owned by the caller, not group- or world-writable, non-empty, under `max_patch_bytes`, no NUL bytes, no CR |
| the worktree | a real directory, not a symlink, with an in-tree `.git` that is not a symlink, and which is the worktree **top level** |
| the diff | unified diff text only; prose, truncated hunks, malformed headers, binary patches, and `Binary files … differ` are all refused |
| paths | no absolute, UNC, drive-letter, backslashed, empty, `..`-traversing, `.`-component, or out-of-charset path; a path that is not representable is refused *without being echoed* |
| denied paths | `.git`, `.gitattributes`/`.gitmodules`, hook and CI directories, `.env*`/`.envrc`, shell startup files, ssh material, keys, certificates, credential stores, cloud config, and this kit's own provider auth directories |
| modes | `new file mode` must be `100644`; `120000` (symlink) and `160000` (submodule) are refused anywhere; `old mode`/`new mode` pairs are refused outright |
| operations | add and modify are allowed; **delete is refused by default**; rename and copy are refused with no override |
| limits | changed file count, path length, patch bytes, patch lines, hunks per file and in total, and added lines per file and in total |
| strip level | the header shape fixes the level, before git is consulted; a shape that fixes none is rejected, not guessed at |

### The strip level, exactly

The level is a property of the patch text, not of whatever happens to apply.
Two header shapes are recognised, because the lanes really produce them:

| shape | headers | level |
|---|---|---|
| `git-prefixed` | `a/<rest>` opposite `b/<rest>`, rests equal, `/dev/null` for the missing side of an add or delete | `-p1` |
| `unprefixed` | no real side begins with `a/` or `b/` — what `delegation-qwen` emits left to itself | `-p0` |

Anything else fixes nothing and is refused before `git apply` runs: `a/x`
opposite `a/x` does not say whether `a` is the prefix or a directory
(`unpaired_path_prefixes`), and a patch mixing the two shapes across files is
`mixed_path_prefixes`. `git apply --check` is then asked one question — does the
patch apply at *that* level — and the answer decides the verdict.

The other candidate is probed too, recorded as `strip.alternate_applies`, and
never chosen (`strip.alternate_chosen` is always `false`):

* For `git-prefixed`, the other candidate is `-p0`, which is not a second
  reading — it is the patch with its prefix left on, naming `a/…` and `b/…`
  paths the receipt does not list. **Every ordinary add applies that way**,
  because `b/src/x` does not exist and `--check` will happily create it. That
  reading is refused, not counted as an alternative.
* For `unprefixed`, the other candidate is `-p1`, which drops a real leading
  component and lands on a different existing file — and `-p1` is git's own
  default, so a lead can reach it by habit. A patch that also applies there has
  a second reading reachable by accident and is rejected as
  `ambiguous_strip_level`.

There is exactly one override, `--allow-delete`. It permits `deleted file mode`
entries, is recorded in the receipt as `allow_flags.allow_delete`, and relaxes
nothing else — path confinement, the denied list, and the limits all still
apply. Renames have no override at all: a rename is a delete plus an add wearing
one name, and the lead should see both halves.

### Read-only, and how that is attested

The verifier writes nothing: not the worktree, not the index, not the git
control directory, not the patch file, not any global configuration. It attests
that rather than asserting it. Four digests — the patch, the worktree state
(`status --porcelain -uall` plus the unstaged and staged diffs), the index, and
the git control directory (HEAD, config, packed refs, ref listing, index digest)
— are taken before and after and compared. A difference is reported as
`verdict: attestation-failed` and exit 70, and is a failure of *this command*
rather than a property of the patch.

Every `git` call runs with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`_SYSTEM`
pointed at `/dev/null`, `GIT_ATTR_NOSYSTEM`, `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, `HOME` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` redirected to an empty private directory, `core.hooksPath`
disabled, and every inherited `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`/object-directory
variable unset. `git apply` is given `--check` and never `--unsafe-paths`,
`--index`, `--cached`, `--3way`, or `--directory`, and it is reached only after
every structural and path rule has already passed — a denied path is never
handed to git at all.

### The receipt carries no patch content

Only paths, counts, operation names, rule identifiers, and digests. No context
line, no added or removed line, and no `@@` section heading is ever captured;
git's stderr is discarded because it quotes patch context on failure; and a path
that fails the representability screen is reported as a rule, never as bytes.
The regression suite plants sentinels in a patch body and in a section heading
and fails if either reaches the receipt.

### How the contract requires it

Every `text-patch` lane declares the same block, and nothing else may:

```json
"patch_policy": {
  "policy_file": "external-patch-policy.json",
  "policy_version": "1.0.0",
  "verifier": "delegation-patch-verify",
  "verification_required": true,
  "applied_by": "lead"
}
```

`delegation-executor-contract check` fails on a missing, stale, or mismatched
block, on a block attached to a lane that returns no patch, and on a policy file
that has drifted open — deletions allowed by default, mode changes permitted,
`--unsafe-paths` no longer refused, a denied-path class removed. The four
governed lanes today are `qwen3.8-max.builder`, `deepseek-flash.builder`, and
the two **blocked** Gemini lanes. Blocked lanes are held to the same rule on
purpose: a declaration that is wrong while blocked becomes wrong and operational
the day it is promoted.

The reference declares a requirement. It grants nothing, promotes nothing, and
no runner reads it — the regression suite asserts that neither the six runners
nor `delegation-route` calls the verifier. It is a tool the lead runs.

Exit codes are the verifier's own: `0` accepted, `64` invalid input, `65`
rejected by policy, `66` unreadable patch or unusable worktree, `69` missing
dependency, `70` the read-only attestation failed.

```sh
delegation-patch-verify policy            # the policy, in full
delegation-patch-verify check --patch "$patch" --workdir "$repo" --json
delegation-patch-verify check --patch "$patch" --workdir "$repo" --allow-delete
```

Override for tests and diagnostics only:
`DELEGATION_EXTERNAL_PATCH_POLICY_FILE`.

## Identity, usage, permission, qualification

Four things that are routinely conflated are kept apart:

| concept | field | what it proves |
|---|---|---|
| requested identity | `identity.requested_model`, `requested_model` | what the user profile requested — never read from a provider response |
| observed / effective identity | `observed_identity_sources`, `effective_content_model` | what the provider says actually produced the content |
| usage participation | `usage_participation`, `usage_participants` | that a model appears in the provider's own billing accounting — **not** that it wrote the content |
| permission class | `permission_class` | what the runner is allowed to touch |
| qualification status | `status` / `selection` | historical qualification evidence; not an operational execution gate |

Usage participation is graded, because the transports genuinely differ:
`first-party-model-usage` (GLM), `model-usage-participants` (Grok),
`provider-usage-totals` (Qwen, DeepSeek), and `none` (Kimi, Gemini). Where it is
`none`, the zero and null token counters are recorded as *absent measurement*,
never as measured cost.

Each family declares an identity contract that `validate --family` enforces on
a real artifact:

- `effective_content_identity` — `must-equal-requested` (GLM, Grok) or
  `not-reported` (the rest). A family that does not report an effective-content
  model may not carry one; a family that does may not carry a different one.
- `usage_participant_model` — the name a participant must carry to count as the
  target. For GLM it is the model itself; for Grok it is `grok-4.6-build`, the
  billing SKU, which is **not** the content identity. Reporting the billing name
  as `effective_content_model` fails.
- `usage_participant_provider` / `usage_participant_canonical_model` — GLM's
  first-party accounting additionally requires `provider: firstParty` and a
  matching `canonicalModel`; Grok's does not, and the contract does not pretend
  otherwise.

`target_usage_participant_present` is true **exactly when** a participant carries
the declared usage-participant model. An artifact with an empty participant list
that still claims the target participated — and still claims
`exact_model_identity_attested` — is rejected. So is an identity attestation
without the effective-content model that substantiates it, a participant object
with an undeclared key or a negative counter, a negative token, cost, or
duration, a `finished_at_epoch` before `started_at_epoch`, a duration longer than
the window it claims, a `usage_source` that contradicts the participant list, and
a status envelope that lists a lane as qualified when the family declares it
provisional.

The participant map is closed by **type** as well as by key. Every field a
participant actually carries is checked against the type declared in
`usage_accounting.participant_fields`, including the nullable ones: the optional
provider identity fields `canonical_model` and `provider` may be a name or
`null` and nothing else, and each token, cache, reasoning, call, and cost counter
must be a nonnegative number. `input_tokens: "ten"` and `cost_usd: "free"` fail;
they are not coerced to zero. The result envelope's token counter object is typed
the same way through `token_counter_value_type`, so `tokens.input: "ten"` fails
too. Type checking reaches the declared envelope fields, that participant map,
and that counter object; provider extension objects are governed by
`extension_policy` instead, and the contract does not claim to type them.

Lane lists in a status envelope are an inventory, not a sample. `qualified_lanes`
and `provisional_lanes` — and `candidate_lanes`, for the runners that emit it —
must equal exactly the lanes the contract puts in that state for the family.
Listing a lane the family declares provisional as qualified fails, and so does
quietly dropping one. A runner that emits no `candidate_lanes` at all is not
required to start; every runner derives these lists from
`config/routing-gates.json`, which the contract is cross-checked against in both
directions.

## Exit codes

The dispatch vocabulary is closed at six values, and the validator rejects any
seventh:

| code | name | retryable | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | `invalid_input` | no | unknown argument, missing/colliding path, refused flag combination |
| 69 | `unavailable` | no | runtime, login, entitlement, key, or quota-window unavailability |
| 70 | `dispatch_failure` | no | dispatch, sandbox, extraction, or publication failure |
| 75 | `temporary_failure` | **yes** | rate limit, overload, 5xx, timeout, transient credential conflict |
| 78 | `gate_refusal` | no | lane not dispatchable, effort not pinned, gates inconsistent, explicit decision missing |
| 130 | `caller_cancelled` | no | the caller interrupted; the runner stopped the child and released its locks |

64/69/70/75/78 are universal — every family must emit them. 130 is not: only a
runner with cancellation handling (today, `delegation-kimi`) declares it.

**These are the runners' codes.** `delegation-executor-contract` is an inspector
and uses its own: `0` ok, `64` invalid input, `65` validation failure, `66`
unreadable file, `69` missing dependency.

## Envelopes

Three artifacts, with a *common minimum* that all six families genuinely emit
today:

| envelope | produced by | common required fields |
|---|---|---|
| status | `<runner> check --json` | `model`, `efforts`, `selected_backend`, `qualified_lanes`, `provisional_lanes`, `backends` |
| result | `<runner> run --metrics <path>` | `model`, `backend`, `effort`, `lane`, `started_at_epoch`, `finished_at_epoch`, `tokens`, `provider_cost_usd` |
| diagnostic | `<runner> run`, on failure, at `<output>.error.json` | `phase`, `reason` |

The diagnostic minimum is small on purpose: it is what is *true today*, not what
would be convenient. `delegation-kimi` names its envelope `schema`, carries
`exit_code`/`vendor_exit_code`, and omits `model`/`backend`/`effort`/`lane`;
`delegation-grok` omits `schema_version` and calls the debug pointer
`debug_path`. Those are recorded in `known_divergences` rather than papered over,
and each family additionally declares the fields *it* guarantees — so
`validate --family glm-5.3-flash` requires the identity fields GLM really emits
while `--family kimi-k3` does not.

### What is normative, and what is not

- **Normative and fail-closed:** the contract file itself. Every map in it is
  closed by key — `vocabularies`, `authority`, `identity_kinds`,
  `usage_participation_values`, `usage_accounting.participant_fields`, each
  lane's `tool_policy`, each family's `identity`, `extension_policy`,
  `executable_gate_controls`, and the envelope declarations. An unknown key
  anywhere, an unknown permission class or capability, a seventh exit code, or a
  lane that contradicts the central gate or an executable gate all fail `check`.
  The two maps that stay open by key are `families` and each family's `lanes`,
  because their key sets are cross-checked bidirectionally against
  `routing-gates.json` and the executable gates — an invented family or lane has
  nowhere to hide.
- **Normative for artifacts:** required fields, declared types — for envelope
  fields, for every participant field a participant carries, and for every
  counter in the token object — closed vocabularies, exact lane inventories, the
  family identity and usage-accounting invariants above, and nonnegative/ordered
  numeric fields.
- **Supported, and filtered:** provider extension fields. Each runner emits its
  own attestations — Kimi's `search_runtime` digests, Grok's sandbox and OAuth
  state, GLM's assistant-event identity accounting — and `validate` reports them
  as `extension_fields` and passes. Rejecting them would push runners toward a
  lowest common denominator, which is precisely the weakening this contract must
  not cause.

What extensions may **not** do is carry a credential or raw provider content.
`extension_policy` rejects, recursively and at any depth, a key whose name is a
credential or raw-content name (`api_key`, `authorization`, `token`,
`credential`, `secret`, `prompt`, `messages`, `request_body`, `response_body`,
`raw_response`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and the rest of the declared list), a key
containing a credential substring (`access_token`, `client_secret`,
`private_key`, …), and a string value shaped like a bearer token or a PEM private
key. Digests of sensitive material — `prompt_sha256`, `contract_sha256` — are the
safe form and stay allowed, as do benign names that merely contain a sensitive
word, such as Grok's `credential_state_shared` boolean.

Be precise about what that buys: it is a **name and shape filter, not a secrecy
proof.** It cannot detect a credential stored under an innocuous key name, and
the contract says so in `extension_policy.notes`. Beyond it, `validate` reads
back and prints only field names, declared vocabulary values, and its own
findings; an offending value is reported as `<credential-shaped value>` and never
echoed. Raw provider material belongs only under an explicit private
`--debug-dir`.

## Using it

```sh
delegation-executor-contract check --json      # contract + both gate cross-checks
delegation-executor-contract families          # the six families and their lanes
delegation-executor-contract family kimi-k3    # one family, in full
delegation-executor-contract classes           # the three permission classes
delegation-executor-contract exit-codes        # the closed dispatch vocabulary
delegation-executor-contract table             # every declaration, as Markdown

delegation-executor-contract validate --envelope result \
  --file "$metrics" --family grok-4.6 --json

delegation-patch-verify check --patch "$patch" --workdir "$repo" --json
```

`check` is what CI, `doctor.sh`, and a gate change should run. It validates the
contract, then cross-checks every declaration against `routing-gates.json`
(model, harness, effort, status, selection, and coverage in **both** directions),
against each executable gate (model, lane set, status, selection, effort, and
all ten `runtime_controls` fields, which every gate row must declare in full),
and against `config/external-patch-policy.json` for the `text-patch` lanes.

Overrides, for tests and diagnostics only:
`DELEGATION_EXECUTOR_CONTRACT_FILE`, `DELEGATION_ROUTING_GATES_FILE`,
`DELEGATION_EXECUTOR_GATE_DIR`, `DELEGATION_EXTERNAL_PATCH_POLICY_FILE`.

## Changing it

The six runners share two sourced libraries under `bin/lib/`:
`delegation-runner-common.sh` (error prefix, hashing, key-file mode, lane
listing by status, OAuth lock wait) and `delegation-chat-completions.sh` (the
whole text-only OpenAI-compatible core that `delegation-deepseek` and
`delegation-qwen` wrap with provider hooks). A fix that belongs to every runner
goes there once; a provider difference stays in the runner as a hook. The
installer copies the libraries next to the runners; they are never on PATH.
Each runner's evaluation `runner_sha256` still hashes the runner file alone —
the libraries are bound through `runner_source_commit` and the clean-checkout
refusal.

A contract edit is a *description* change and must follow reality:

1. Change the runner first, if runner behaviour is what moved. The contract never
   leads.
2. Update the declaration **and** the matching `runtime_controls` block in the
   family's executable gate — they are compared exactly, so one without the other
   fails — then run `tests/external-executor-contract.sh`.
3. Never edit a lane's `status`/`selection` here to make `check` pass. Those
   mirror `config/routing-gates.json`, and a promotion remains an explicit owner
   decision made in the gates — see [`../CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/matteoscurati/delegation-kit/blob/main/CLAUDE.md).
4. If a runner genuinely diverges from the common envelope, record it in
   `known_divergences`. A recorded gap is honest; a silently relaxed required
   field is not.
5. A change to `config/external-patch-policy.json` is a change to a **trust
   boundary**, not a limit tweak. Bump `policy_version`, update the
   `patch_policy` block on the top-level reference *and* on every `text-patch`
   lane — they are compared exactly — and run
   `tests/external-patch-verify.sh`. Never widen the policy to make a
   particular patch pass; a patch the policy refuses is one the lead reads by
   hand.
