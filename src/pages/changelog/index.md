[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/matteoscurati/delegation-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
in the kit repository by `npm run sync-kit` — edit there, not here. Tags follow
`delegation-kit--v<version>` and each one has a GitHub Release.

<!-- BEGIN AUTOGEN -->

## [0.25.0] — 2026-09-11

The idea behind 0.24.0 was that which model runs is the user's call, not the
kit's. That release made it true for the user and left the qualification
machinery in place as history. This release removes it.

### Removed

- **Routing gates.** `config/routing-gates.json` and the six executable
  `config/*-routing.json` gates. No runner, router, or preset reads a gate
  any more; `install.sh` deletes the installed copies on upgrade.
- **The executor contract, evidence, and Epoch importer.**
  `bin/delegation-executor-contract` with
  `config/external-executor-contract.json`, `bin/delegation-evidence` with
  `config/model-evidence.json`, and `bin/delegation-epoch`, together with
  their suites (`external-executor-contract.sh`, `epoch-zip.sh`) and the CI
  step that ran them. `uninstall.sh` keeps removing the retired commands for
  one release.
- **The schema compiler.** `bin/delegation-schema` and `schema-transport.sh`;
  it served only the evaluation mode below.
- **The runners' qualification mode.** `--evaluation`,
  `--evaluation-manifest`, and `--preflight-only` are gone from
  `delegation-glm`, `delegation-kimi`, `delegation-grok`, `delegation-gemini`,
  and the shared chat-completions core behind `delegation-qwen`,
  `delegation-deepseek`, and `delegation-openai-compatible`, with the manifest
  verification, preflight receipts, attempt receipts, publication commit
  markers, and the "dirty checkout" refusal. Passing a removed flag is an
  unknown argument (exit 64). The Grok strict-identity VOID path is gone: a
  missing content model is tolerated everywhere, a surfaced mismatch still
  fails closed.
- The gate-status helpers in `bin/lib/delegation-runner-common.sh`, the
  `evidence` column of `delegation-route`, compound lanes, and the doctor
  sections "Model-routing evidence", "Central routing gates", and "External
  executor contract".
- `docs/external-executors.md` shrinks from the contract description to the
  adapters, permission classes, patch verifier, identity, and exit codes.

### Changed

- **`config/presets.json`** is the shipped profile list (22 profiles, Gemini
  excluded), maintained by hand; `delegation-config init` copies it. The npm
  wrapper verifies this file instead of the gates. A legacy
  `routing-gates.json` is still imported on first migration and falls back to
  the preset when it is malformed.
- **Runner `check`** reports `{model, adapter, roles, efforts,
  selected_backend, backends}` (plus `default_effort` for the chat-completions
  adapters and the native runtime controls); `qualified_lanes`,
  `provisional_lanes`, and `candidate_lanes` are gone. An unsupported role or
  effort exits 78 before any credential or runtime inspection.
- **`delegation-route`** reports schema 3: rows carry `technical_compatibility`,
  `capabilities`, and `selection` only.
- Doctor gains a "Route discovery" section over the personal configuration,
  reads adapter roles from each runner, and pings through adapter roles.
- `--allow-provisional` stays a deprecated no-op that prints a warning; it is
  removed in the next minor release.
- CLAUDE.md replaces "Routing gates" with "Presets and configuration";
  `evaluation/README.md` is marked as an archive; `model-routing.md` states it
  governs nothing.

### Migration

- Nothing to do for a 0.24.0 personal configuration: the schema is unchanged.
  Re-run `./install.sh`; it removes the retired files and commands from the
  data directory. Profiles that name a model the provider no longer serves
  (for example `deepseek-v4-pro`) are the user's to edit in the personal
  configuration.
- Scripts that called `delegation-executor-contract`, `delegation-evidence`,
  `delegation-epoch`, `delegation-schema`, or a runner's `--evaluation` mode
  have no replacement; the frozen artifacts under `evaluation/` remain as a
  record.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Personal configuration.** `delegation-config init|validate|show|apply`
  manages `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/delegation-kit/config.json`
  (schema 1, `DELEGATION_CONFIG_FILE` override): profiles carry an adapter, the
  actual requested model, a declared family, roles, and supported parameters.
  Credentials are never stored in profiles; `credential_env` names a variable
  for the three HTTP adapters. `init` derives a preset from the historical
  gates, snapshots a legacy install as `migration-v1-backup`, and never
  overwrites an existing file; `apply` regenerates managed Claude/Codex
  snippets and preserves edited ones. `install.sh` runs `init` and `apply` and
  keeps hand-edited host profiles.
- **`delegation-run`.** One dispatcher runs a selected profile once through its
  adapter and writes output, metrics, and a version 2 `.result.json` receipt
  with `review_status`, requested versus provider-reported identity, and
  `authorization_granted: false`. Native `codex` and `claude-code` profiles run
  read-only through the CLIs; provider runners keep their own sandboxes.
- **`delegation-openai-compatible`.** A text-only adapter for any OpenAI-
  compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint on the shared chat-completions core:
  HTTPS required except loopback, one non-streaming request, optional bearer
  auth, no `/models` call, no tools, no retry.
- `docs/user-configuration.md` and the `user-config` regression suite
  (loopback HTTP, isolated configuration, no provider accounts).

### Changed

- **Review is optional by default**, for new and migrated installs.
  `required` accepts any compatible reviewer, `cross-family` requires two
  declared, different families. A mandatory policy never authorizes the
  reviewer call: results stay `pending-review` until the lead obtains it.
  `init --preset strict` selects `cross-family`.
- **The router reads the personal configuration** and reports schema 2:
  `configuration_valid`, `technical_compatibility`, `capabilities`, and the
  historical `evidence` per row; `check`, `lane`, `profile`, `resolve`, and
  `table` stay read-only; a compound lane returns its members and protocol
  and requires separate member selections.
- **Evidence and gates are advisory.** `config/routing-gates.json`, the
  executable gates, the executor contract, `delegation-evidence`, and
  `evaluation/` keep their historical meaning and validation, but no longer
  grant or block execution; adapters own capabilities, roles, and efforts.
  `--allow-provisional` is accepted as a deprecated no-op everywhere.
- **DeepSeek re-pinned to `deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, released
  2026-09-10).** DeepSeek routes every `deepseek-v4-pro` request to V4.1 Flash
  after 2026-09-14 12:00 Beijing time, which would have failed the runner's
  exact identity check on every dispatch. Profile, executable gate
  (`config/deepseek-flash-routing.json`, the V4 Pro gate is removed on
  upgrade), contract family, runner default, doctor, installer, tests, and
  docs follow. One live exact-identity smoke at `max` passed on 2026-09-10; the
  builder lane stays provisional and explicit-only in the historical record.
- **Gemini re-pinned to `gemini-3.8-flash`** on the staged bridge (gate
  `config/gemini-3.8-flash-routing.json`, the 3.7 gate is removed on upgrade),
  every lane still candidate or disabled; Gemini is excluded from the current
  presets by owner decision and existing personal choices are preserved.
- Doctor gains a "Personal configuration" section (configuration valid,
  review policy, managed snippets, the new commands on PATH, the builder lane
  resolving selectable profiles) and describes the runners by their adapter
  defaults instead of pinned qualification.
- Reviewer profiles on both hosts apply the configured review policy instead
  of hard-coded cross-family exclusion; the resident guards describe the three
  policies.

### Removed

- The routing-gate drift suite (central gate versus executable gates,
  producer-family exclusion, fallback). With execution no longer gated by
  evidence, those checks guarded a decision the kit no longer takes;
  `delegation-executor-contract check` and `delegation-evidence check` still
  validate the historical records for consistency.

### Fixed

- The Antigravity inventory parser matches exact ids in tab-separated
  ID/display-name rows.
- `config/deepseek.env` is gitignored like the other key files.

## [0.23.1] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **`delegation-grok` reported "ready" on a machine where every dispatch
  failed.** Grok Build 1.0.13 denies the container runtime sockets
  (`/var/run/docker.sock`, podman, containerd, and the Docker Desktop paths
  under `~/.docker`) in every sandbox profile and resolves each endpoint before
  applying Seatbelt; when one is a symlink — Docker Desktop's optional default
  socket link — a custom profile such as `delegation-kit` is refused outright
  ("Refusing to start with its protections missing"), while the capability
  probe and model inventory still succeed. `check` now probes those endpoints
  after resolving the CLI and reports the lane unavailable with the offending
  path and the remedy; `run` fails closed at exit 69 before dispatch; and a
  refusal surfaced by the CLI itself is classified as
  `sandbox_profile_refused` (exit 69) instead of a generic `dispatch_failed`.
  `DELEGATION_GROK_RUNTIME_SOCKET_ENDPOINTS` overrides the endpoint list for
  tests. Found by the first live Grok probe since 2026-08-27, on a machine
  where the link had appeared on 2026-08-28.
- `install.sh` said the compatible Grok Build CLI archive was *not* retained
  whenever the runtime was unavailable, even though the archive was in place;
  the message now depends only on the pinned archive, and runtime availability
  is doctor's report.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- `delegation-route table` rendered its Fallback column from a field the rows
  never carried (`fallback` instead of `provider_fallback`), so the declared
  `opus-reviewer` security fallback to `claude-opus-4.8` never appeared. The
  column now shows the target model and trigger; `tests/routing-gates.sh`
  asserts it.
- README and `doctor.sh` still named Sol as the Codex reviewer/judge after the
  0.22.0 migration to GPT-6 Astra; both now say Astra.
- `fable-judge` was pinned to the `fable` alias while the central gate binds
  `claude-fable-5-1`; the agent, `doctor.sh`, and the suites now pin the exact
  id, matching `opus-builder` and `opus-reviewer`.
- Removed the unused `found_name` helper from `doctor.sh`; `.gitignore` now
  covers `.hermes/` per-machine agent state.

### Changed

- **Shared runner library.** `bin/lib/delegation-runner-common.sh` holds the
  helpers that were copied into every external runner (`die`, `have`,
  `sha256_file`, `key_file_mode`, `normalized_destination`, lane listing by
  status, `acquire_oauth_lock_wait`). All six runners source it after resolving
  their install root; `install.sh` copies it to `$DATA_HOME/bin/lib` and never
  links it onto PATH. `runner_sha256` still hashes the runner file alone — the
  library is bound by `runner_source_commit` and the clean-checkout refusal.
- **Shared chat-completions core.** `bin/lib/delegation-chat-completions.sh`
  is the whole text-only OpenAI-compatible transport; `delegation-deepseek` and
  `delegation-qwen` are now thin wrappers that set their identity and define
  provider hooks (request body, key validation, usage accounting, the Qwen
  next-snapshot probe). Both suites pass unchanged.
- **Router.** The five near-identical jq blocks that compared the Kimi, Qwen,
  DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok executable gates against the central gates are
  one `check_executable_gate` function; `resolve` computes the eligible rows
  and choices once. JSON output is byte-identical to 0.22.0.
- `docs/compatibility.md` verified snapshot refreshed on 2026-09-07 with the
  numbers observed for this release.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **Codex review/judgement lanes migrate from Sol to GPT-6 Astra** (`gpt-6-astra`,
  effort `high`) on the owner decision following OpenAI's 2026-09-03 launch.
  New family `openai-gpt6` (distinct from gpt-5.6) keeps cross-family review
  meaningful. `astra-reviewer` @ high covers material-review and security;
  `astra-judge` @ high replaces `sol-judge` @ max. Super-judgement is now
  Fable 5.1 + Astra. Verified live on Codex CLI 0.153.4.

### Fixed

- `.gitignore` now covers `config/qwen-token-plan.env` (the Qwen Token Plan
  key file), which was previously unprotected.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **Judgement lane migrates from Fable 5 to Fable 5.1** (`claude-fable-5-1`,
  still at `max`, still manual-qualified explicit-only) on the owner decision
  following Anthropic's 2026-09-01 launch. `fable-judge` and the central gate
  bind to the exact `aa-claude-fable-5-1-max` row; Fable 5 evidence is retained
  as context. Verified live: authenticated Claude Code returned exact PONG and
  surfaced `claude-fable-5-1` at requested max. This owner decision does not
  convert coding evidence into judgement qualification. Super-judgement
  (Fable 5.1 + Sol) semantics are unchanged.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- The npm wrapper consumed `--skip-doctor` but also forwarded it to
  `install.sh`, which refuses unknown arguments and exited 2. The wrapper now
  consumes the flag; the test asserts `install.sh` never sees it.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added

- **User-directed activation** (`activation_policy` in
  `config/routing-gates.json`): every dispatch must be selected or explicitly
  delegated by the user for the current request. The selection vocabulary is
  now closed at `explicit-only` / `blocked`; `default`, `fallback`, and
  `preferred-explicit` are removed and all lane-local `fallback` pointers are
  gone. PR #56.
- `delegation-route resolve --selected-profile <profile>` validates one exact
  user-selected profile (exit 78 if it is not selectable for the lane) and the
  resolve output now returns `choices` / `selected` / `selection_validated`
  with `requires_user_direction: true`. PR #56.
- `delegation-patch-verify` and `config/external-patch-policy.json`: a
  read-only, fail-closed trust boundary for text-patch lane output — path
  confinement, denied-path classes, capability and limit checks, strip level
  fixed by header grammar, read-only attestation. PR #55.
- The external-executor contract now covers the patch policy: every
  `text-patch` lane declares the policy version and verifier, and `check`
  fails on a missing, stale, or drifted declaration. PR #55.
- npm distribution: `npx delegation-kit` runs the universal installer without
  a manual clone (thin wrapper; installed artifacts are unchanged).

### Changed

- Resident policies replaced by a minimal user-direction guard on both hosts
  (`claude/CLAUDE.delegation.md`, `codex/AGENTS.md`): no standing permission
  to delegate, authorization is per dispatch and never carries to retries,
  reviews, or additional workers. `install.sh` registers it; `doctor.sh`
  verifies it on both hosts. PR #56.
- All eight skills are explicitly user-triggered; `orchestrate` no longer
  mandates hidden agent calls — the user-approved finite dispatch list is the
  budget. PR #56.
- The external-executor contract mirrors the closed vocabulary: every
  dispatchable lane carries `requires_explicit_decision: true`. The contract
  still describes and validates only; each runner remains the sole
  enforcement authority. PR #56.
- README restructured for clarity: why/quick-start/how-it-works flow, the
  governance model in one place, and a command reference table.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Promote `glm-5.3-flash` / `claude-zai` / `max` as the sole GLM route after
  the exact v4 pack passed 9/9 no-retry attempts at score 1.0. All 204 assistant
  events carried the exact Flash identity, every terminal `modelUsage` reported
  the sole canonical first-party Flash participant, and every builder checker
  passed. Clerk/scout are qualified explicit-only; builder is provisional
  explicit-only. Historical GLM-5.3 and Flash v1-v3 evidence is not relabelled.
- Keep Claude Code and Bun temporary paths inside the evaluation scratch and
  preserve `USER` in the sanitized environment. The first Flash attempt never
  reached the provider because the frozen native CLI tried to create
  `/tmp/claude-501`; that attempt remains a terminal `VOID`.
- Record the terminal v3 identity probe and align future strict extraction with
  the actual Claude Code/Z.AI stream: content-bearing assistant events expose
  `message.model`, while `modelUsage` carries `canonicalModel` and `provider`.
  V3 is not relabelled; the fresh v4 pack supplies the evidence used by the
  promotion recorded above.

### Verified

- The exact v4 pack completed 9/9 no-retry attempts at score 1.0 for
  `glm-5.3-flash` / `claude-zai` / `max`; all 204 assistant events had complete
  Flash attribution, every usage record named the sole canonical first-party
  Flash participant, and all three builder checkers passed 6/6 tests.
- The release candidate passed all 12 regression suites in 52 seconds, 59
  routing checks, ShellCheck, JSON/evidence validation, the eight-check version
  gate, `git diff --check`, and independent cross-family review with verdict
  `SHIP`.
- A clean release-candidate install matched source across the GLM runner, both
  gates, and the Claude/Codex executor skills. Static doctor reported
  `55 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL`; `doctor.sh --ping --ping-glm` reported
  `58 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL`, with GLM-5.3-Flash and both bridge directions
  returning `PONG`/reachable.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-08-27

### Added

- Added `delegation-grok run --oauth shared` for concurrent Grok Build workers.
  Operational runs share one runner-owned persistent `GROK_HOME` generation,
  use the vendor auth lock for refresh coordination, and hold the kit lock only
  for generation adoption and atomic publication. External `grok login` wins a
  conflict; corrupt or superseded OAuth state fails closed. Evaluations remain
  serialized.

### Fixed

- Serialized Grok runs now hold an OAuth lock for the complete dispatch and
  atomically publish validated refreshed credentials back to the ambient login,
  instead of deleting a refreshed token with the ephemeral HOME. Sandbox
  attestation uses a unique per-run profile and ignores peer/malformed events;
  the agent cannot edit the credential, policy, or attestation files. Superseded
  credential generations are bounded instead of accumulating at rest.

### Verified

- The 0.18.0 release candidate passed all 12 regression suites in 52 seconds,
  59 routing checks, ShellCheck, evidence validation, version consistency, and
  `git diff --check`. A real two-worker Grok 4.6/high smoke returned `PONG`
  twice in about five seconds, left both workspaces empty, and finished with
  ambient/shared OAuth hashes aligned. The provider did not separately expose
  the effective content model, so the smoke is operational compatibility proof,
  not strict model-identity evidence. The installed release candidate matched
  source across the changed runner, gates, and skills; the live doctor command
  completed with `57 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL`.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Reworked the native routing policy so Sonnet and Luna are limited to very
  small, non-builder clerk/scout/routine-review tasks. The former
  `sonnet-builder` and `terra-scout` profiles are retired; the old
  `opus-reviewer/high` profile is replaced by a max-effort cross-family reviewer.
- Added `opus-builder` at `claude-opus-5` / `max` and made it the fallback to
  the default `terra-builder` at `gpt-5.6-terra` / `max`. Added separate
  read-only `opus-reviewer` and `terra-reviewer` profiles, also at `max`, so both
  high-level models can build or review without mixing permissions.
- Added an explicit model-family registry and fail-closed cross-family review
  rule. Every routine/material/security review resolution now requires the
  producer profile or family, removes all same-family reviewers, and exposes the
  exclusions in the router output. Runtime availability must still be checked;
  no eligible reviewer means stop, not self-review.
- This is a breaking routing migration: callers resolving a review lane must
  now pass `--producer-profile` or `--producer-family`; omission exits `64`
  instead of selecting a potentially same-family reviewer.
- Promoted security review from the former manual Opus-only route to
  producer-aware provisional defaults/fallbacks across Sol, Terra, and Opus.
  The Opus path continues to disclose Anthropic's possible Opus 4.8 fallback
  for classifier-flagged cyber requests; exact Opus 5 identity is not guaranteed
  on that path. The former native `senior` route now has no operational profile.
- Re-pinned the read-only `sol-judge` profile from `high` to `max` and
  `fable-judge` from `xhigh` to its verified supported `max` on explicit owner
  effort decisions. Both remain manually qualified and explicit-only; coding
  rows at the exact max tuples are contextual, not judgement evidence.
- Recorded a scoped installed-profile smoke for `opus-builder`: the exact
  Opus/max request changed only its assigned file, passed `git diff --check`,
  and surfaced `canonicalModel: claude-opus-5`. The lane remains provisional;
  one synthetic edit is compatibility evidence, not general qualification.
- Updated installation, cleanup, doctor, routing tests, and policy documents to
  enforce the new role and family boundaries and remove stale installed profiles.
- Fixed the release doctor so its missing-producer probe preserves the caller's
  shell options, and added an end-to-end regression for Codex configurations
  without a root-level `sandbox_mode`.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- Added `delegation-deepseek`, its executable and central gates, installer,
  doctor checks, executor skill, and regression suite. The official
  `deepseek-v4-pro` API is pinned to `max`; only the text-only `builder` lane is
  provisional/explicit-only after one exact live patch smoke, and every other
  lane remains blocked.

### Changed

- Re-pinned the fail-closed Antigravity bridge from Gemini 3.6 Flash to
  `gemini-3.7-flash`, including its gate, skill, policy, installer, doctor, and
  tests. No operational Gemini lane is inherited: the current local session
  cannot attest exact 3.7 inventory/OAuth, so all new routes remain blocked.
- Refreshed the evidence registry with first-party Gemini 3.7 Flash and DeepSeek
  V4 Pro sources and contextual benchmark claims; neither source auto-qualifies
  a lane.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **Sol becomes Codex's default material reviewer without widening its role.**
  `sol-reviewer` at `high` moves from manual explicit selection to the
  provisional `material-review` default on an explicit owner decision. It
  remains read-only and provisional because no exact review precision/recall
  row exists. `sol-judge`, judgement, and `super-judgement` remain manual and
  explicit-only; routine review and executor lanes are unchanged.
- **GLM-5.3/max replaces every previous GLM route across the active executor.** The exact
  high/max comparison ran three no-retry attempts per lane on the same frozen
  runner. Both efforts scored 1.0 in all nine attempts and passed every builder
  checker; the preregistered efficiency rule selected high (372s, $0.334234)
  over max (505s, $0.719138), after which the owner explicitly selected max as
  the sole operational effort. Clerk and scout are qualified explicit-only and
  builder remains provisional explicit-only. The 5.2 and 5.3/high gates and
  central profiles were removed; upgrades delete stale installed copies while
  frozen receipts remain historical. The selected tuple was requalified 9/9 on
  the final max-only runner bytes; the public result records digests for both
  the comparison and operational receipts.
- The evidence snapshot records Z.ai's GLM-5.3 release, Coding Plan access,
  effort mapping, and launch benchmark claims as contextual-only evidence. No
  independent tracked leaderboard had a GLM-5.3 row on 2026-08-14.

### Fixed

- `delegation-glm` now reads model and profile identity from the selected
  executable gate, permits only `glm-5.3/max`, and
  capability-probes Claude Code with a ten-second fail-closed timeout. A
  separately verified native binary can be selected explicitly for diagnostics
  without weakening model, lane, effort, sandbox, or manifest checks.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **Grok 4.6 replaces Grok 4.5 across the active integration.** The runner,
  central and executable gates, skills, installed Claude/Codex policy, doctor,
  documentation, and regression fixtures now pin `grok-4.6` through Grok Build
  at effort `high`. `builder` and `frontend-builder` remain provisional and
  `preferred-explicit`, so every dispatch still requires an explicit decision
  plus `--allow-provisional`; no reviewer, senior, or judgement lane was added.
- The 2026-08-12 evidence snapshot adds separate Grok 4.6 observations from
  CursorBench 3.2, FrontierCode 1.1, APEX-SWE, APEX Agents, Code Arena WebDev,
  and xAI's launch material. Every row is contextual: the independent results
  use non-production harnesses, WebDev is preliminary, and xAI's figures are
  first-party claims. Grok 4.5 benchmark rows remain historical evidence and do
  not support the new route.

### Fixed

- Grok metrics no longer mistake a `modelUsage` billing participant for the
  model that authored the content. They record the requested model, any
  separately surfaced effective content model, and all usage participants,
  summing their tokens and cost. A surfaced mismatch fails every lane closed;
  a strict evaluation with no content-model identity is `VOID` rather than a
  false pass.
- Upgrading removes the installed `grok-4.5-routing.json` and installs the 4.6
  gate atomically with the current router and evidence snapshot before checking
  a retained private CLI archive. A portable upgrade regression covers stale
  gate removal, new-gate installation, and archive retention without depending
  on the user's authentication state.

### Verified

- All ten regression suites, ShellCheck, JSON/evidence/gate validation, and the
  version/tag consistency checks pass. After reinstalling the dirty release
  candidate, `delegation-grok check --json` resolved Grok Build CLI `0.2.114`
  with `grok-4.6-build`, and `./doctor.sh --ping-grok` returned `PONG` with
  `42 OK, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL`.

## [0.13.2] — 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **The Agent Arena row for Gemini 3.6 Flash had five of its six effects
  recorded with the wrong sign.** The board encodes each effect's direction as a
  coloured triangle rather than a character, so the automated capture that built
  the 0.13.0 snapshot read every value as positive; the row was committed with
  `sign_inferred` and only `net_improvement_pct` flipped, on an inference from
  the sort order. Read visually from the rendered board, the model is negative
  on **every** effect: net improvement `-3.01%`, confirmed success `-1.63%`,
  praise vs complaint `-5.19%`, bash recovery `-2.69%`, and steerability
  `-6.70%` — that last one being the scout lane's own supporting metric, which
  makes this the difference between "unproven" and "measurably worse than the
  baseline agent in real sessions". The flag is gone and the row now states that
  its signs were read, not inferred. The rows near the boundary were re-read too:
  GPT 5.6 Sol, Luna, and Terra at ranks 5, 17, and 18 are positive as recorded,
  so the error was isolated to the one row below the inflection.
- `skills/qwen-executor` now tells the brief to demand `a/` and `b/` diff header
  prefixes. The text-only builder lane returns a patch the lead applies, and left
  to itself the model emits `--- <path>` on both sides; `git apply` defaults to
  `-p1` and strips one leading component precisely because of that convention, so
  an unprefixed header resolves to a path that does not exist and a correct patch
  fails to apply — which reads like a wrong answer and is not one. Re-dispatched
  with the instruction, the model returned prefixed headers and the patch applied
  with a bare `git apply`. The skill also records `-p0` as the recovery for a
  patch already in hand.

## [0.13.1] — 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **The Gemini lane was unreachable from an SSH session, whatever the user did.**
  `agy` picks its credential store from the environment: seeing `SSH_CLIENT`,
  `SSH_CONNECTION`, or `SSH_TTY` it switches to a file-based token store and
  never consults the macOS Keychain. `delegation-gemini` supplies credentials the
  opposite way — `prepare_isolated_home` symlinks the user's
  `~/Library/Keychains` into the isolated home and carries nothing else — so over
  SSH the CLI looked in a store that was never written, `agy_status` reported
  `agy model inventory unavailable`, and every dispatch failed closed with exit
  69. Signing in again could not help: the login landed in the Keychain that the
  CLI had already decided to ignore. The runner now clears the three markers for
  every `agy` call that can touch credentials — the plugin inventory, the model
  inventory, and the dispatch itself. On a local session they are unset already,
  so this is a no-op there, and it grants nothing new: no additional tools, no
  filesystem access, only which credential store the CLI consults. Verified end
  to end from an SSH session: `check` reports `ready` and a real `scout` dispatch
  returned a correct answer at exit 0.
- The unavailable-runtime reason now says to keep the login keychain unlocked,
  since that is the only store this runner can read; the previous text sent the
  reader to an interactive sign-in that would not have fixed the SSH case.
- `tests/gemini-runner-diagnostics.sh` now runs its whole suite with SSH markers
  exported, and its `agy` stub exits 90 if any of them reaches the CLI. Neutering
  the fix makes the suite fail, so the regression is real rather than vacuous.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-08-05

### Changed

- **Routing gate — the three Codex executor lanes are re-pinned above the effort
  cliff.** `luna-clerk` moves `low` → `max`, `terra-scout` `low` → `medium`, and
  `terra-builder` `medium` → `max`. Lanes, models, harnesses, sandboxes, and
  statuses are unchanged; only the pinned effort moved. The reason is that the
  cheap models do not degrade gracefully and the kit had its two highest-volume
  lanes pinned where they collapse: on the exact Artificial Analysis rows
  `gpt-5.6-luna` at `low` scores 15% SWE-Atlas-QnA — the clerk *required* metric
  — against 33% at `max`, and the Epoch effort ladder puts the same model at
  1.5% DeepSWE at `low` against 67.2% at `max`. `terra-builder` gains both
  builder required metrics: DeepSWE 46% → 67% and Terminal-Bench v2 69% → 84%,
  at $2.76 rather than $0.90 per task. Each new effort was chosen because it
  already carries an *exact* benchmark row, so no lane trades measured evidence
  for expected capability. Owner decision on measured evidence, recorded in each
  lane's `qualification_basis`.
- **Routing gate — Kimi K3 and Grok 4.5 become `preferred-explicit` on
  `builder`** (they already were on `frontend-builder`). Both remain
  `provisional` and still require an explicit decision plus
  `--allow-provisional`; only the ordering among external builders changed. They
  are the only two carrying both builder required metrics on an exact production
  tuple, so they now rank above `glm-builder` and `qwen3.8-max`, which carry
  none. This records preference, not qualification: Kimi's local evaluation is
  still a quota-truncated run and Grok's a single non-held-out task.
- Codex reasoning-effort support is per model, not global, and reaches further
  than this repository claimed. Probed against the provider on 2026-08-05:
  `gpt-5.6-terra` enumerates `none · minimal · low · medium · high · xhigh ·
  max` and ran at `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; `gpt-5.6-sol` and `gpt-5.6-luna`
  ran at `xhigh` and `max`; `gpt-5.5` **refuses** `max`. The effort table in
  `model-routing.md` previously stopped every Codex row at `high`.

### Fixed

- `delegation-evidence check` silently passed a broken snapshot. It ran
  `age="$(validate)"`, and a command substitution does not inherit `set -e`, so
  the `jq -e` covering schema, id uniqueness, and source references could fail
  while `check` still printed `valid` and exited 0 — only the freshness check,
  which uses an explicit `return`, was effective. The validation now fails with
  exit 65 and a message naming the file. Caught when a snapshot whose rows
  referenced three nonexistent sources was reported as valid.
- `preferred-explicit` had no positional meaning: `delegation-route resolve`
  emitted the `explicit` array in profile-insertion order, so a plain
  `explicit-only` profile could be listed ahead of a preferred one. Preferred
  entries now come first, insertion order preserved within each group.

### Added

- 65 dated evidence rows and three sources in `config/model-evidence.json`:
  Agent Arena (data 2026-08-03, 1,607,993 sessions — first Claude Opus 5 rows,
  entering at ranks 1 and 3), Code Arena WebDev (data 2026-08-01, 510,194 votes
  — first `qwen3.8-max` row at rank 4, which is the `frontend-builder` required
  metric for a model that has no such lane), and the Epoch AI ZIP of 2026-08-04,
  whose first import of the DeepSWE effort ladder is what made the cliff visible.
  Existing rows are untouched; the gates reference them by id. Every Epoch row is
  `contextual_only` because `mini-swe-agent` is not a production harness, and the
  Gemini Agent Arena row carries `sign_inferred` because the board's sign is not
  machine-readable.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added

- `delegation-kimi run --oauth shared` (or `DELEGATION_KIMI_OAUTH_MODE=shared`):
  concurrent Kimi dispatches. Until now the kit lock spanned the whole run, so
  a second agent died instantly with exit 75 — but the vendor supports ~30
  concurrent instances when they share one `KIMI_CODE_HOME`, coordinating
  refresh-token rotation through the CLI's own cross-process oauth lock. In
  shared mode, OAuth state lives in a runner-owned *generation* under
  `$DELEGATION_DATA_HOME/kimi-shared-oauth`; each run's isolated home symlinks
  its `credentials/` and `oauth/` dirs at that generation so the vendor lock
  coordinates the children, and the kit lock shrinks to two brief critical
  sections (seeding the generation, publishing it back to the ambient home).
  Generations — not hash markers — keep a dead token family from clobbering a
  credential after an external `kimi login`; a busy kit lock at publish time
  defers to the next run instead of failing. The serialized default and its
  sandbox profile are byte-for-byte unchanged, `--evaluation` runs always
  serialize, and the live two-parallel smoke against the real CLI passed on
  2026-08-04 with a real mid-run rotation through the symlinked generation.
- `DELEGATION_KIMI_OAUTH_WAIT_SECONDS` (default 5, 0 = fail immediately):
  bounded wait on the kit lock for shared-mode seed and publish.
- delegation-glm now distinguishes two 429 shapes in `<output>.error.json`:
  reason `rate_limited` (retry with backoff) versus `quota_exhausted`, which
  carries the window-reset epoch in the new `next_flush_time` field
  (diagnostic `schema_version` 2). Z.AI's numeric body codes never reach the
  runner — a captured stream shows `api_retry` carries only the HTTP status —
  so quota detection keys on the `rate_limit_event` reset epoch instead.

### Fixed

- The delegation-glm stderr fallback grepped for Z.AI code `1312`, which does
  not exist in the published error table, and missed `1302` — the actual
  rate/concurrency code.
- A stray 429 event in an otherwise-completed GLM stream no longer overwrites
  an extract-phase reason (`empty_result`, `model_mismatch`, …) with
  `rate_limited`: reclassification is now scoped to dispatch failures.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Made the CI release-tag check fetch the real tag object before validating it.
  `actions/checkout` maps the commit SHA onto `refs/tags/<name>`, leaving a
  lightweight ref even when the pushed tag is annotated, so the 0.11.0 tag run
  failed with `tag is annotated: expected 'tag', got 'commit'` while the tag
  itself was correct on both the server and locally.
- Made `tests/version-consistency.sh --tag` fail when the tag object is absent
  instead of silently skipping the annotation and subject checks. A silent skip
  left the convention unenforced in exactly the environment it was written for.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- `install.sh` now writes `installed-version.json` into the data home, and
  `doctor.sh` compares it against the checkout. Until now a stale install was
  undetectable: every other doctor check inspects the installed copy against
  itself and passes while it lags the repository. A version mismatch is a FAIL,
  a same-version commit mismatch is a warning, and installs from a dirty
  checkout or with `--claude-only`/`--codex-only` scope are recorded so the
  marker never overstates what was installed.
- Added `tests/install-version-marker.sh`, which installs into isolated homes
  and asserts both the marker's contents and that doctor detects version drift,
  commit drift, a missing marker, and a missing install.
- Added `run-tests.sh`, which runs every suite in parallel on one machine and
  prints the full log of any that fails. CI uses it, cutting the macOS job's
  test step from ~116s to well under half without allocating a second runner.
  `--sequential` restores one-at-a-time output for debugging.

- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Until now nothing verified a release except
  the person cutting it. Every pull request and push to `main` now runs
  shellcheck at `-S warning`, the version-surface check, and the regression
  suites on macOS; a tag push additionally validates the tag against the
  manifest version. Suites run on macOS because the Kimi runner requires
  `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` and the Grok suite asserts BSD `stat -f` modes.
- Added `tests/version-consistency.sh`, which enforces the CLAUDE.md release
  rules: the five version surfaces must agree, the newest changelog section must
  be the shipped version, and `--tag` validates the
  `delegation-kit--v<semver>` annotated-tag convention.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Repinned the Qwen bridge from `qwen3.8-max-preview` to `qwen3.8-max` after the
  model left preview on 2026-08-02. The rename rests on a local Token Plan probe
  confirming `GET /models` lists the unsuffixed id and that a chat completion
  pinned to it returns `.model == "qwen3.8-max"` with `reasoning_effort: xhigh`
  accepted; the `-preview` id still resolves in parallel. Renamed
  `config/qwen3.8-max-preview-routing.json` to `config/qwen3.8-max-routing.json`
  and the central gate profile to `qwen3.8-max`.
- Promoted the Qwen `builder` lane to **provisional / explicit-only** at `xhigh`
  on an explicit owner routing decision. `delegation-qwen run` now accepts
  `--allow-provisional`, which is mutually exclusive with `--evaluation`; the
  previous blanket refusal of every provisional lane is gone. Every other lane
  stays a blocked candidate, and `judgement` stays disabled.
- Cleared the Qwen `policy-annotation` manifest allowlist in both gates. The
  frozen manifest was bound to the `qwen3.8-max-preview` profile, model, and
  runner hash, so it can no longer validate; regenerate it against the new tuple
  before any evaluation run. The frozen v2/v3 evaluation artifacts are
  historical records and were deliberately left unrewritten.

### Documentation

- Recorded the promotion as an owner decision rather than measured capability.
  A 2026-08-03 re-check of the Artificial Analysis coding-agent board and
  Terminal-Bench 2.1 still found no `qwen3.8-max` row, so both builder required
  metrics (`coding.deep_swe_pass_pct`, `coding.terminal_bench_v2_pass_pct`)
  remain unmet and `exact_evidence_ids` stays empty. Alibaba has published no
  benchmark table for the model.
- Added the contextual `qwen-3.8-max-ga-launch` evidence row and its
  `qwen-3.8-max-ga-2026-08-03` source. Its metrics live under `launch.*` so they
  cannot satisfy any lane's `required_metrics`. The snapshot date stays
  2026-07-31 because this was a targeted re-check, not a full refresh.
- Documented that the Qwen builder lane is text-only: the chat-completions
  transport exposes no tools and no terminal, so it returns a patch the lead
  applies and verifies rather than editing a worktree, and it is prompt-only.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added `delegation-schema`, a read-only deterministic compiler and verifier for
  Claude Code and Codex structured-output transport schemas.

### Fixed

- Made GLM lane evaluation compile its manifest-bound schema for Claude before
  dispatch, while leaving the normative schema and frozen protocols unchanged.
- Made schema compilation preserve literal objects and property order, reject
  non-standard JSON, and fail closed on unsupported Codex keywords, unions, and
  documented Structured Outputs limits.
- Made `doctor.sh` use Claude's provider-free auth status and warn when a
  sanitized macOS environment drops `USER` and therefore Keychain resolution.
- Made `doctor.sh` exercise both the Claude and Codex compiler paths before
  reporting the installed schema transport helper healthy.

### Documentation

- Defined separate requested, effective, and observed-usage model evidence for
  Claude safety fallback and internal classifier telemetry, including aggregate
  token/cost accounting and exact-identity `VOID` behavior.
- Documented provider-specific schema preflights for raw Claude and Codex
  bridges; `--help` checks alone are not semantic compatibility checks.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Raised the maximum manifest-bound Kimi evaluation timeout from 600 to 1200
  seconds. Operational Kimi runs remain capped at 900 seconds.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- Added hash-allowlisted, manifest-bound qualification for GLM clerk, scout,
  and builder at the exact `glm-5.2` / `claude-zai` / `high` tuple.
- Added portable lane-specific structured-output schemas, per-attempt receipts,
  full worktree and Git-control attestation, and a public minimal aggregate for
  the frozen repeated comparison.
- Refreshed current GLM and cross-model context from Agent Arena, Code Arena
  WebDev, Terminal-Bench 2.1, SWE-bench-Live, OpenBench, Z.ai, and Epoch.

### Changed

- Qualified GLM clerk and scout as explicit-only routes after three valid
  repeats matched the best incumbent on each bounded pack.
- Moved GLM builder from candidate/blocked to provisional/explicit-only after
  all three GLM attempts and all three Terra incumbent attempts passed the
  deterministic checker. Builder still requires `--allow-provisional`.
- Extended central gate validation so private GLM qualification allowlists may
  cover clerk, scout, and builder without creating an operational route by
  themselves.

### Fixed

- Made the GLM runner actually pass the manifest-bound output schema to Claude
  Code and extract structured output without changing the historical
  policy-annotation path.
- Replaced a non-portable generic comparison schema with lane-specific schemas
  accepted by both Claude Code and Codex.
- Hardened GLM qualification with fixture-only data reads, a native-CLI process
  allowlist, an empty environment, immutable `.git`, ignored/untracked file and
  executable-mode hashing, and disabled Claude keychain prefetch. The final
  runner passed independent security review and macOS sandbox canaries.

### Documentation

- Documented the exact local decisions, costs, latency limitation, invalidated
  runner/preflight series, and two `VOID` Claude builder comparator attempts
  caused by an out-of-fixture write. No attempt in the final v6 series was
  retried.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Removed downstream Dipylon evaluation packs from the repository, installer,
  doctor, routing allowlists, and pack-specific tests.
- Kept only kit-owned qualification manifests in the central routing allowlist
  and added a generic invariant that every allowlisted manifest is tracked.
- Preserved the generic Qwen 900-second evaluation ceiling and timeout
  classification introduced alongside the downstream packs.

### Documentation

- Documented that project-specific evaluation packs belong in their owning
  repository or artifact registry and are deliberately ignored here.
- Kept the 0.7.1 Claude Code, Codex, and external-runner compatibility matrix as
  the reproducible compatibility snapshot for this patch release.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- Added a reproducible compatibility matrix for all shipped Claude Code agents,
  Codex profiles, and gated external runners.
- Recorded semantic smoke expectations, cross-CLI round-trip verification,
  fail-closed Qwen behavior, and byte-for-byte installation checks.

### Documentation

- Clarified that `codex exec --ephemeral -p <profile>` must not be combined
  with `--ignore-user-config`, which also suppresses the selected profile.
- Clarified that Claude read-only roles expose Bash for inspection and therefore
  do not have the same OS-enforced write isolation as Codex read-only sandboxes.
- Preserved all existing provisional, candidate, and blocked routing decisions;
  successful runtime verification is not a model promotion.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- Upgraded the Kimi bridge to a capability-probed Kimi Code runtime with
  lane-specific agent files and a digest-attested ripgrep allowlist.
- Added bounded cancellation, timeout handling, sanitized heartbeat/error
  diagnostics, and explicit OAuth finalization.

### Security

- Confined Kimi process execution to the selected CLI, `/usr/bin/true`, and the
  exact pinned ripgrep runtime under the macOS sandbox.
- Kept all Kimi lanes provisional and explicit-only without changing historical
  evaluation manifests.
